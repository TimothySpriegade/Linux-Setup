## Welcome to my Linux Setup Repository

---
This repository contains all the scripts and configurations I use to set up my Linux environment. 
This repository focuses on different Distros and Desktop environments. The goal is to also distinguish between private installation and work installation due to different requirements.
This repository is a work in progress and is open to suggestions and contributions.


## Installation

---
To install the scripts and configurations, you can simply clone the repository and run the setup script. The setup script will install all the necessary packages and configurations for the selected distro and desktop environment.

```bash
git clone 'enter repository link here' 
chmod +x ./Linux-Setup/init.sh
./Linux-Setup/init.sh
```
